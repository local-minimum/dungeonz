# Untitled casual dungeon game

Player uses wealth to expand dungeon, enlist various worker roles to explore, defend and secure the dungeon.

Player pays to get a `hand` of tiles with connectors (exits / doors) that they are free to place in the world.
Player can pay to get a new `hand` before first hand is exhausted.
There are two classes of `blocks` to be placed. `Rooms` that hold wealth, and `halls` that connects rooms.

Upon either closing off all exits on a level or having build sufficiently large level a `stairs down` appears,
which allows to build next level and finalizes current level.

The deeper the more lucerative and also more dangerous. More monsters spawn.

Player can also enlist by roles. For each role there are different levels too.
Player can upgrade workers if they've gained enough experience.
Workers cost in upkeep.

Player does not direct workers.

## Explorer

Explorers are unique in finding treasures and mapping out what resources can be gathered in various rooms.

They can extract *some* simple types of treasures.

They can carry *some* treasure back to the surface but they are not very good at it and gets grumpy if they 
are not allowed to explore.

They are also almost defenceless

## Hauler

These really love to carry stuff.

They are not very easy to kill but do no damage.

They can extract *some* simple types of treasures.

## Miners

Extracts all types of goods.

They don't carry stuff, that's someone elses job.


## Warriors

They fight. That's it.

They work best solo and tend to spread out as evenly as possible.

They are very confident independent of level so they don't organize themselves to let the weakest have the easiest
job. Instead the closest one fills any percieved vacume.


## Trappers

Can defend themselves but rather not.

Constructs traps that are safe to workers but bad for monsters.

## Medics

Sometimes dungeons hurt, and then you need someone to care for you

## Decorators

Others really wonder why they go about painting and hanging drapes in the dungeon. But they say it's important.
Monsters don't like beauty, and so they make everyone else safer. Or so they say.
